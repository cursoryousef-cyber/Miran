// ============================================================================
// Capability model — the authorisation vocabulary of the training platform.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// The legacy `permissions` table speaks in verbs that are too coarse to express
// the boundary the business actually needs. `assign_rotations` is held by both
// `cluster_administrator` and `hospital_administrator`; measured against each
// other, those two roles share 9 of 10 training permissions. There is literally
// no permission string in the old vocabulary that means "may move a trainee
// between hospitals" as distinct from "may move a trainee between departments
// of my own hospital" — so the separation between cluster training management
// and hospital training management could not be enforced, only described.
//
// Capabilities are that missing vocabulary. The pair that carries the whole
// architecture is:
//
//   allocation.cluster.*   — the cluster training manager places trainees INTO
//                            hospitals, and moves them BETWEEN hospitals.
//   allocation.hospital.*  — the hospital training manager places trainees into
//                            departments and trainers WITHIN one hospital.
//
// No role holds both. That is the separation, stated once, in one place.
//
// A capability is never sufficient on its own. Every authorisation decision is
//     capability  ∧  active context type  ∧  resource within visible scope
// which is why each entry below also declares the context it must be used from.
// See scope-context.service.ts for how the scope half is resolved.
